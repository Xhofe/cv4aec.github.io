            <p>The workshop will connect the domains of Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) with that of Computer Vision by establishing a common ground of interaction and identify shared research interests. These topics will be presented from the dual lens of Computer Vision and AEC, highlighting the limitations and bottlenecks related to developing applications for this specific domain. The objective is for the two communities to come together and solve problems that are relevant in the AEC community, such as understanding the construction sites as it is changing, as well as automatically generating building models from scans of real data.</p>

<p>This workshop will also host the first Scan-to-BIM challenge focused on key problems when converting 3D point cloud data obtained using lidar, photogrammetry, or depth map cameras to Building Information Models (BIMs). BIMs represent different elements of a building in a semantically rich manner, identifying objects, associated attributes, and geometrical and topological relationships. AEC firms and public agencies create BIMs to design new buildings and other structures; however, BIMs are rarely available for existing buildings or facilities. For maintenance, retrofitting, or renovation AEC entities could greatly benefit from access to BIMs of their facilities, because interpreting 2D as-built drawings is very time consuming and leads to many errors and omissions. Furthermore, asset owners could use BIMs for operations and maintenance as BIMs enable storing and having access to attributes such as maintenance history, material type, manufacturer specifications among others.</p>

<p>However, current computer vision evaluations are mainly done on familiar evaluation metrics such as Intersection-over-Union (IoU) or classification accuracy, rather than metrics that are more relevant in practice in the AEC community, such as geometrical and topological connections between different spaces and openings. This challenge aims to bring the computer vision, civil engineering, geomatics, and construction communities together by creating new tasks and evaluation metrics that can be tackled by computer vision researchers while being of interest to and fulfilling the objectives of the AEC community. </p>

		  <p><b>Vision for Construction in Practice: Lessons from Startup Experience</b></p>
		  <p><i>Prof. Derek Hoiem, CS, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</i></p>
		  <p>As computer vision becomes increasingly useful, researchers should think beyond the abstract technical problems to contexts and workflows of application. Doing so increases potential for research impact and can reveal new technical challenges. I will show examples of evolution from technical solutions to workflow solutions for the built environment from my work at Reconstruct and highlight important research problems that remain.</p>

		  <p><b>Digitalisation beyond BIM: Towards a data-driven future of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC)</b></p>
		  <p><i>Prof. Eleni Papadonikolaki, The Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction, UCL</i></p>
		  <p>The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) undergoes massive transformations through the influence of its socio-political environment and digital economy. Digital economy becomes increasingly topical in the AEC since skills shortage on construction sites and estates offices is growing and recent restrictions in the movement of workers (see Brexit) continue the traditional overreliance on people’s judgement and experience, without leveraging technology and data. In our technology-laden world, various opportunities arise from novel ways to capture, clean, analyse and visualise a wealth of data, previously not tamed. Digital technologies and the pervasiveness of data create new opportunities and challenges in AEC projects, especially in information sharing, decision-making and knowledge management. From these, many proprietary solutions promise to provide quick, ‘hands-off’ and off-the-shelf answers to persistent problems such as low efficiency, productivity and poor quality. However, the complexity of data and AEC projects have shown that quick and off-the-shelf solutions, such as the promise of Building Information Modelling (BIM) for the AEC rarely work on their own. Instead, as digital technologies continuously evolve and become more integrated, there is a need to push the boundaries of BIM especially during project execution and hand-over phases – the less digitised phases of AEC – ensuring a meaningful digital thread, supported by automation and machine learning. Problematising around the interfaces among people, technology and data, how can we lead project teams and develop our people to leverage data and excel in digital economy?

		  <p><b>HouseGAN: Teaching Computers to Design Architecture</b></p>
		  <p><i>Prof. Yasutaka Furukawa, CS, Simon Fraser University</i></p>
		  <p>We have made a breakthrough in the domain of automated floorplan generation with the research in the past few years. Our latest system takes a form of a "relational refinement GAN with convolutional message passing", which is a result of our 3 recent papers (CVPR 2020, ECCV 2020, CVPR 2021). I will explain what the three key research insights are in the three papers, forming the latest system. An interactive demo is available only at http://www.houseganpp.com. This research is a joint work with Greg Mori and Autodesk Research.</p>

		  <p><b>Scan-to-BIM for Energy Efficiency Renovation of Buildings</b></p>
		  <p><i>Prof. Frédéric Bosché, CEE, University of Edinburgh</i></p>
		  <p>The mission of the EU-funded BIMERR project is to design and develop an ICT-enabled Renovation 4.0 toolkit comprising tools for Architecture, Engineering & Construction (AEC) actors in the process of delivering the energy efficiency renovation of existing buildings. 
This talk will first briefly present the BIMERR project, but then focus on the Scan-to-BIM solution developed to output models that can be directly and effectively used by the Renovation Decision Support System (RenoDSS) tool. The process involves several tools: the Scan-to-BIM tool, the BIM Management Platform, and ultimately the RenoDSS tool. The talk will present that process, but will naturally focus on the Scan-to-BIM tool and the different functionalities that it includes for `structural’ modelling (i.e. modelling of walls, floors and openings), MEP modelling and product property editing. The talk will conclude with some reflection on the contributions made and necessary future developments.

				<p>The dataset is available <b><a href="https://deepreality.allvision.io/">HERE</a></b>. You will need a registered account to download the dataset. Once you submit a request for registration, it will be inspected and a registration link will be sent to you within 24 hours. The challenge contains a total of 31 buildings with multiple floors each and dozens of rooms on each floor. Of which, 20 buildings are designated as the <i>training</i> set, with a total of 49 point clouds. The validation and testing 
sets contain 5.5 buildings with 21 point clouds each. For each model, there is a point cloud in LAZ format. For the training and validation sets, a corresponding floorplan aligned with the coordinate system of the point cloud is also provided.
				<br>	<b>NOTE: </b> If you have downloaded 
				the data prior to May 3rd noon PT, please note that we have an updated version of the data, with the CAD model coordinates aligned with the input point cloud, which has replaced the original version.</p>
				<p><b>Floorplan Reconstruction Task:</b> For the floorplan reconstruction task, the <i>training set</i> consists of the point clouds of 20 buildings with multiple floors each, with a total of 49 point clouds, as well as corresponding 2D building models for each floor with multiple extracted layers. These layers include: walls, curved walls, doors, windows, stairs, and columns. The buildings have complicated floor structures which could include dozens of rooms, curved walls and many doors on each floor. We have released 6 new buildings as the <i>validation set</i> and another 6 as the <i>testing set</i>. The <i>validation set</i> contains point clouds and their corresponding 2D building models. For the <i>testing set</i>, only the point clouds will be made available, while the 2D building models will not be made available and we will host a server to evaluate the submissions.

				<p> <b> NEW (May 12th) </b> The validation and testing sets have been released! </p> 
				<!--<p><b>Floorplan Reconstruction Task:</b> We provide 2D building models for each floor described as both a binary OBJ file and a JSON file with extracted layers. These layers include: walls, curved walls, doors, windows, stairs, and columns. A detailed description of the file format can be found <a href="filespecs.html">here</a>. We will have 6 buildings as the <i>validation</i> set and another 6 as the <i>testing</i> set. The validation set, which contains point clouds and their corresponding 2D building models, will be made available on a later date. The testing set models will not be made available and we will host an evaluation server to evaluate submissions.-->

					under main.ipynb file. The file formats for obj and JSON are detailed below.</p> -->
				<p><b>3D Building Model Reconstruction Task:</b> For the 3D building model reconstruction task, the <i>training set</i> consists of point clouds of 4 buildings with multiple floors, as well as the corresponding 3D building model in AutoCAD DXF format. We aim to release 2 more buildings for the <i>validation set</i> and 2 more as the <i>testing set</i>. The evaluation on the testing set will also be hosted on the evaluation server in a similar manner to the floorplan reconstruction task.</p>

				<p>We will include metrics to evaluate the reconstruction of the walls, doors, floor area and windows.</p>
				<p><b>2D Evaluation Metrics</b></p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">
				<b>Geometric Metrics:</b><br/>
				<ul style="text-align:left;">
					<li><i>IoU</i> of the each room (a room is defined as a completely separated area with walls and doors).</li>
					<li><i>Accuracy of endpoints</i>. Precision/Recall and F-measure will be evaluated in the coordinate system of the point cloud. The provided endpoints will be matched with the Hungarian algorithm to the point cloud, and every point that is within a certain threshold will be determined as a match.</li>
					<li><i>Orientation</i>. For each matched line between the ground truth, we will compute the cosine similarity metric between them as the normalized dot product. If a line is not matched with ground truth, the cosine metric will be zero. Finally, the metric will be averaged over all the ground truth lines.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">
				<b>Topological Metrics:</b><br/>
				We will also evaluate topological metrics that measure whether the connectivity of the rooms match the ground truth.
				<ul style="text-align:left;">
					<li><i>Warping error(<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5539950">Jain et al. 2010</a>).</i>The warping error will first warp the predicted floorplan to the ground truth with a homotopic deformation, and then compute the pixels that cannot match after the deformation.</li>
					<li><i>Betti number error.</i>The Betti number error will compare the Betti numbers between the prediction and the ground truth and output the absolute value of the difference.</li>

				<h4 class="section-heading text-uppercase text-center" style="margin-top:100px">Evaluation and Submission</h4>
				<p> The evaluation code for the 2D floorplan task is available from <a href="https://github.com/seravee08/WarpingError_Floorplan">This GitHub Repository</a>. For 3D, because of the difficulty to come up with correct ground truth and have a consistent file format that is 
					acceptable to both the computer vision and AEC communities, we have decided that we will use an expert panel to evaluate the submissions manually. We will aim to have automatic evaluations for the challenges in next years.</p>
				<p>Submission of results on the testing set and evaluation on the ground truth data is now available on the <a href="http://deepreality.allvision.io">evaluation server</a>. For 2D, the submission will be
			           in the same JSON format as in the ground truth provided to you. For 3D, the submission will be in DXF or Wavefront OBJ formats.</p>
